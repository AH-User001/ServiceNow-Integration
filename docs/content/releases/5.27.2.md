**Bug Fixes**

* Adjusted logic for "rolling the day" to occur when the normal session starts (instead of with the pre-market session starts). The logical day now consists of three sessions (normal, post-market, and pre-market). Notably, this logical day now spans two calendar days.
* Adjusted DDF parsing logic for XML snapshots. During pre-market hours, erroneous assignment of data the prior logical day was removed.
* Adjusted DDF parsing logic for XML snapshots. During pre-market hours, erroneous use of `previous` price from form-T session was removed.
